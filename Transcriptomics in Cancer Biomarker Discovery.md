# Transcriptomics in Cancer Biomarker Discovery

Biomarker discovery involves identifying and validating biological indicators, or biomarkers, essential for detecting, diagnosing, monitoring, or predicting the course of diseases and how patients respond to treatments. These biomarkers are measurable attributes within the body, such as proteins, genes, metabolites, or other molecular signatures, offering valuable insights into normal physiological processes, pathological states, and responses to therapeutic interventions (Goossens et al., 2015).

Transcriptomics studies all RNA transcripts within a cell population, typically employing high-throughput technologies like microarrays and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Tsimberidou et al., 2022; Van Rensburg & Loxton, 2015). This area of research, which examines the full range of RNA molecules including messenger RNA (mRNA), non-coding RNA, and microRNA is essential for understanding gene expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms in cells, thereby serving as a vital tool in the discovery of cancer biomarkers.

In cancer, the transcriptome undergoes significant changes due to mutations, epigenetic alterations, and other cellular disruptions, leading to the upregulation of oncogenes and downregulation of tumour suppressor genes, which contribute to tumour development and progression. Additionally, the transcriptome is dynamic, varying with environmental and developmental cues, and is influenced by epi transcriptomic modifications, which have been linked to cancer progression and aggressive tumour behaviour (Tsimberidou et al., 2022; Van Rensburg & Loxton, 2015).

Transcriptomic data have been integrated into tumour molecular profiles to identify targetable alterations and expand therapeutic options for patients with advanced cancer, as seen in breast cancer studies where gene expression profiling identified highly targetable genes in both primary tumours and metastatic lesions. Notably, tests like Oncotype DX (Tsimberidou et al., 2022) and MammaPrint, which analyze gene expression in breast cancer tissues, are used in clinical practice to predict cancer recurrence, assess prognosis, and guide personalized treatment decisions.

Another example is the identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as biomarkers in various cancers. LncRNAs, unlike messenger RNAs (mRNAs), do not code for proteins but play crucial roles in gene expression regulation (Qian et al., 2020). The study discusses several lncRNAs that have been identified as potential biomarkers for various cancers, including prostate and liver cancer. These lncRNAs are overexpressed in cancer tissues and can be detected in body fluids, making them promising non-invasive biomarkers for early detection (Qian et al., 2020).

In conclusion, transcriptomics is an essential tool for cancer biomarker discovery, offering comprehensive insights into gene expression patterns that are crucial for understanding cancer development, progression, and treatment response. This knowledge facilitates the creation of more accurate diagnostic tests, prognostic markers, and targeted therapies, ultimately enhancing early detection and personalized treatment. Ongoing advancements in transcriptomic technologies and data analysis are furthering our capacity to discover novel biomarkers, paving the way for more effective and individualized cancer therapies.
